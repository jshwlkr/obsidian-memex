The Benign Violation Theory of humor claims that humor occurs at three conditions: 1) a threatening of one's sense of how reality "aught to be", 2) the threat seems benign, and 3) a person perceives both the first two conditions simultaneously. The origin seemingly originates in the perception of violation in the presence of play fighting acts.
