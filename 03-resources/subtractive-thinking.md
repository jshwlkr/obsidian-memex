The human mind tends to reach additive solutions faster than subtractive ones. Subtractive solutions tend to require more effort to recognize, though are not necessarily harder to conceptualize. Because we tend to favor additive solutions in our search for possibilities we tend to often overlook subtractive ones, regardless of their potential superiority. (As reported in Nature, [People systematically overlook subtractive changes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03380-y), and then noted in [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/our-brain-typically-overlooks-this-brilliant-problem-solving-strategy/).)
