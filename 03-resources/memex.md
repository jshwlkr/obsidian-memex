The [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) is an experiment in digital gardening and an attempt at joining the learn in public philosophy.

There is technically no table of contents, if you so choose you must fall down the rabbit hole and click a link (internal links have brackets, external links do not). You may find some guidance via the graph icon in the upper right.

This is a personal space that contains work-in-progress thoughts that do not offer any suggestion of perfection. Anything you find here is not authoritative and is not a representation of my best work. It is, however, a representation of my interests and current knowledge. To that end, I have a right to be incorrect or incomplete in my work here and I have a right to change or remove content as I continue to learn. Be aware URLs and site structure are not permanent.
