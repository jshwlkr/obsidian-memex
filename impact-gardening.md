["Impact gardening"](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/surface-of-jupiter-s-moon-europa-churned-by-small-impacts) is an astrogeology term for the surface disturbance caused by the crashing of extraterrestrial objects into planetary bodies. The force of this disturbance can both sterilize potential organic matter and push it deeper into the surface of the planetary body, like planting a garden.
